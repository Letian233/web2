    'Hero', 
    'Crafting Timeless Gastronomic Memories in the Heart of London Since 2005', 
    'Nestled in the cobblestone lanes of London’s iconic Soho district, Savour & Sage emerged not as a mere restaurant, but as a lifelong dream of siblings Eleanor and James Hale, whose childhood was spent in their grandmother’s countryside kitchen, stirring pots of slow-simmered stews and baking artisanal bread at the crack of dawn. What began as a tiny bistro with just 8 tables and a handwritten menu has blossomed over nearly two decades into a revered culinary destination, beloved by locals and international food connoisseurs alike. Our core promise has never wavered: to turn every ingredient into a masterpiece that honors its origin, while weaving in contemporary techniques that surprise and delight the palate. From the first crumb of our house-made sourdough, slathered with whipped ricotta and wild honey harvested from our family’s apiary, to the last sip of our carefully curated wine list featuring small-batch vineyards from across Europe, every detail is intentional. We believe that dining is not just about sustenance—it is about connection: connection to the land that feeds us, connection to the artisans who craft our ingredients, and connection to the loved ones we share our meals with. For over 18 years, we have welcomed strangers who leave as family, and we continue to strive each day to create moments that taste like home, yet feel like a once-in-a-lifetime luxury. Our dining room, with its exposed brick walls, vintage chandeliers, and floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the bustling Soho streets, serves as the perfect backdrop for intimate dinners, celebratory gatherings, and quiet evenings of solo indulgence. Whether you’re joining us for a leisurely weekend brunch featuring our famous shakshuka with house-smoked salmon, or a sophisticated tasting menu that takes you on a journey through the British countryside’s seasonal bounty, Savour & Sage is more than a restaurant—it’s a place where memories are seasoned with passion and served with pride.',

    'Our Story', 
    'From a Country Kitchen Dream to a London Culinary Institution', 
    'The story of Savour & Sage begins in 1999, when Eleanor Hale, a trained pastry chef who had cut her teeth in the kitchens of Paris’s Michelin-starred restaurants, returned to her native England with a vision: to create a space where traditional British cuisine was elevated, not compromised. She partnered with her brother James, a sommelier with a knack for sourcing hidden gem vineyards and artisanal producers, and together they set out to find a home for their dream. After months of scouring London’s neighborhoods, they stumbled upon a tiny, dilapidated shopfront in Soho, tucked between a vintage clothing store and a cozy bookstore. The space was far from perfect—it had creaky wooden floors, a small kitchen with barely enough room for two stoves, and a leaky roof—but it had soul, and that was enough for the siblings. They spent the next six months renovating the space themselves, sanding the wooden floors until they shone, repurposing old barn wood to build the bar, and hanging family heirlooms on the walls to add a personal touch. When Savour & Sage finally opened its doors in 2005, the menu featured just 12 dishes, all made with ingredients sourced from family farms within a 50-mile radius. The response was overwhelming—locals lined up around the block for a taste of Eleanor’s slow-roasted lamb shank with red wine reduction and James’s carefully paired organic wines. As the years went by, the restaurant expanded, adding a private dining room in 2010 and a rooftop garden in 2015 where they grow their own herbs, tomatoes, and edible flowers. What never changed, however, was their commitment to quality and authenticity. Today, Savour & Sage remains a family-run business, with Eleanor still at the helm of the kitchen, experimenting with new flavors while staying true to her roots, and James still curating the wine list, traveling the country (and beyond) to find the perfect bottle to complement each dish. Over the years, we’ve earned numerous accolades—including a Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2012 and being named "London’s Best Local Restaurant" by The Guardian three years in a row—but our greatest reward is the loyal community of guests who return week after week, year after year, to share in our passion for great food and great company. This is our story, and we can’t wait to write the next chapter with you.',

    'Our Philosophy', 
    'Farm to Table, Heart to Plate—Honoring Ingredients and Community', 
    'At Savour & Sage, our culinary philosophy is built on three core pillars: respect for ingredients, commitment to community, and passion for craft. We believe that great food starts with great ingredients, and that means going to great lengths to source the freshest, most sustainable, and most authentic produce available. Unlike many restaurants that rely on large distributors, we have spent years forging personal relationships with small-scale family farmers, fishermen, bakers, and cheesemakers across the United Kingdom and beyond. Our meat comes from free-range farms in the Cotswolds, where the cattle graze on lush green pastures and the pigs are raised on a diet of apples and root vegetables. Our seafood is sourced directly from day boats in Cornwall and Devon, ensuring that every fish and shellfish we serve is caught that morning, at the peak of its freshness. Our cheeses are handcrafted by artisanal cheesemakers in Wales and Scotland, many of whom have been perfecting their craft for generations, and our bread is baked fresh every morning by a local bakery that uses traditional sourdough techniques and organic flour. We are also deeply committed to sustainability—we compost all of our food waste, use only biodegradable packaging for takeaway orders, and source our electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Our rooftop garden not only provides us with fresh herbs and produce, but also serves as a habitat for local bees and birds, helping to support the urban ecosystem. Beyond our commitment to ingredients and sustainability, we believe that restaurants have a responsibility to give back to the communities they serve. That’s why we partner with local food banks to donate excess food each week, host free cooking classes for underprivileged youth, and participate in community events that celebrate local culture and cuisine. We also employ a team of local residents, many of whom have been with us for years, and we invest in their growth by providing training and opportunities for advancement. Finally, we believe that cooking is a craft—one that requires patience, precision, and a whole lot of heart. Our chefs don’t just follow recipes; they infuse every dish with their own creativity and passion, taking traditional dishes and adding a modern twist that surprises and delights. We don’t cut corners—we slow-roast our meats, hand-chop our vegetables, and make our sauces from scratch, because we believe that the extra time and effort is evident in every bite. At the end of the day, our philosophy is simple: we want to serve food that makes people feel good—good about what they’re eating, good about where it came from, and good about the community they’re supporting. That’s the Savour & Sage way, and it’s been that way since day one.',

    'Our Team', 
    'A Family of Passionate Culinarians and Hospitality Experts', 
    'Savour & Sage is more than a restaurant—it’s a family, and that family extends far beyond Eleanor and James Hale. Our team is made up of over 40 passionate individuals, each with their own unique story and set of skills, who come together every day to create an unforgettable dining experience for our guests. At the heart of our kitchen is Eleanor Hale, our Head Chef and co-founder. Eleanor’s love for cooking began in her grandmother’s countryside kitchen, where she would spend her weekends helping to bake bread and prepare Sunday roasts. After studying at the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she worked in some of the world’s most renowned Michelin-starred restaurants, including Alain Ducasse’s eponymous restaurant in Paris and The Fat Duck in Bray. But it was always her dream to return home and create a restaurant that felt like family, and that’s exactly what she’s done with Savour & Sage. Alongside Eleanor is our Sous Chef, Maria Gonzalez, who joined the team in 2010 after immigrating to London from Spain. Maria brings a wealth of knowledge of Spanish tapas and Mediterranean cuisine, which she weaves into our seasonal menus, adding a vibrant and flavorful twist to traditional British dishes. Our Pastry Chef, Thomas Bennett, is a wunderkind who joined us at the age of 21 and has since become known for his innovative desserts—from his salted caramel and apple crumble with homemade vanilla ice cream to his chocolate fondant with raspberry coulis that oozes perfectly when cut open. In the front of house, James Hale, our co-founder and Wine Director, leads a team of knowledgeable and friendly servers and sommeliers who are dedicated to making every guest feel welcome. James’s passion for wine began when he was a teenager, working in a small wine shop in his hometown, and he has since traveled the world, visiting vineyards in France, Italy, Spain, and Argentina to source the perfect bottles for our wine list. Our Sommelier, Sophie Carter, is a certified wine expert who can help guests find the perfect wine to complement their meal, whether they’re a seasoned wine connoisseur or a novice looking to try something new. Our Front of House Manager, David Thompson, has been with us since 2006 and has a knack for remembering guests’ names and favorite dishes, making every visit feel like a reunion with old friends. Beyond our core leadership team, our servers, bussers, bartenders, and kitchen staff are all integral parts of the Savour & Sage family. Many of our team members have been with us for years, and we pride ourselves on fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment where everyone’s voice is heard and their talents are celebrated. We believe that happy employees lead to happy guests, and that’s why we invest in our team with competitive wages, paid time off, and opportunities for professional growth. Whether it’s our kitchen team working tirelessly to prepare the perfect dish, our front of house team going above and beyond to make guests feel welcome, or our management team ensuring that every detail is perfect, every member of the Savour & Sage team shares one common goal: to create a dining experience that is as memorable as it is delicious. We are more than just colleagues—we are a family, and we can’t wait to welcome you into our home.',
